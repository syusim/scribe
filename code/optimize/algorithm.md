ReqdPhys(E, P, i):
return the physical props required by the i-th child of E to provide physical
props P.

OptimizeGroup(G):
To optimize a group G requiring physical properties P:
For each expression E in G, optimize E

I ask you "can you provide this for me natively."
If the answer is yes, compute this and cost it.
Then try weakening the phys props.
