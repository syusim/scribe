Today we're going to build a very simple relational query engine.
Specifically, we're going to do an implementation of the most basic of all query languages,
the SPC algebra.

 a | b 
---|---
 1 | 2 

We'll start by defining some types:

% relational-types

this is the interface:

% node-interface

isn't it cool?

Let's implement it for a scan:

% scan

now a select:

% select1

we can make this better by pushing filters down:

% push-filter-into-cross
