*Note: this is not a serious tutorial, just a kicking-of-the-tires for my site generator.*

Today we're going to build a very simple relational query engine!
We'll start by defining some types to represent a relational result set:

% relational-types

A _volcano node_ is an object representing a relational query.

% wahhh

We'll represent them with this interface:

% node-interface

Let's implement it for a scan:

% scan

Now a select:

% select1

While we're constructing a `Select` operator, if we spot an optimization, we can apply it on the spot:

% push-filter-into-cross
